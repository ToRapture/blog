# Retransmission
TCP sets a timer when it sends data, and if the data is not acknowledged when the timer expires, a timeout or timer-based retransmission of data occurs. The timeout occurs after an interval called the retransmission timeout (RTO). It has another way of initiating a retransmission called fast retransmission or fast retransmit, which usually happens without any delay. Fast retransmit is based on inferring losses by noticing when TCPâ€™s cumulative acknowledgment fails to advance in the ACKs received over time, or when ACKs carrying selective acknowledgment information (SACKs) indicate that out-of-order segments are present at the receiver. Generally speaking, when the sender believes that the receiver might be missing some data, a choice needs to be made between sending new (unsent) data and retransmitting.
